Every key on our keyboard has a code that identifies it.  
This app lets you see that code every time you press a key.  
The app shows you both the "keyCode" property of the key, which is deprecated and should not be used but it still works, and the "code" property of the key, which is the recommended way of accesing keyboard events.

Noteworthy features:
* **ternary operator** which is used as a shorthand for an if statement  
* template literals  
* event listener.
