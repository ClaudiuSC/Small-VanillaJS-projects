Dice game which works by rolling one dice and alternating between two players. 
The numbers on the dice add up and the first to reach a score of 20 wins.
When one player wins he is declared winner and a reset button appears with wich you cand start a new game.


Improvements:
* because player 1 always starts first he has the most chances to win => randomise the player which starts first.
* double or nothing button;
* add animation on dices.
* a flying cow could randomly apper and steal one of the players points.
