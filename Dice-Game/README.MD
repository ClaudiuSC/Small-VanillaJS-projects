Dice game which works by rolling one dice and alternating between two players.  
The numbers on the dice add up and the first to reach a score of 20 wins.  
When one player wins he is declared winner and a reset button appears with wich you cand start a new game.


Improvements:
* because player 1 always starts first he has the most chances to win => randomise the player which starts first OR declare a winner after both players have the same number of dice rolls(and if both pass the 20 points marker the player with most points wins, if tie, roll again).
* double or nothing button;
* **add animation on dices - added animation;
* a flying cow could randomly apper and steal one of the players points.
