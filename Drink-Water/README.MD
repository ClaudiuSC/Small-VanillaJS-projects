A project from **Brad Traversy**'s Udemy course: **50 Projects in 50 Days** but with a different aproach on the JS side.

It is a bit more flexible, in the way that everything is calculated by the number of elements in the dome(in this case cups of water) and i fixed an error which was generated when trying to access an element outside of an array.

This current version could be improved by providing user input with the number of cups and the math would still work.
